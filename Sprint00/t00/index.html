      <h2 id="C4">What makes a superhero?</h2>
      <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a<br>
            superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use<br>
            that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br>
            For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a<br>
            good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal<br>
            human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>

            intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime.Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers;<br> 
            he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in <br>
